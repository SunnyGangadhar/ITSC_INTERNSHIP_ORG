Furthermore, Jenkins has several plugins at its repository to support the build, deployment, and automation of any project. Jenkins is pretty easy to install and configure. It can be installed as a native package or brought up as a docker image or run from a portable installation on a machine with Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Jenkins is designed and developed with a master-slave architecture such that it can efficiently distribute work across multiple machines so that you can work as a team to build applications, test them quickly and deploy them to production then and there."
